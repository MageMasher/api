## Summary

Currently unused. Expected to refer to an [doc:cljs.core/IWriter] object
representing standard output for print operations, as it is in Clojure.

## Details

This is used in internally by pprint.

May work eventually with Node targets, along with `*in*` for standard input and
`*err*` for standard error.
