## Summary

Requires [doc:compiler-options/static-fns] `true`. This option emits slightly
different code that can speed up your code around 10-30%. Higher order function
that donâ€™t implement the IFn protocol are normally called with `f.call(null,
arg0, arg1 ...)`.  With this option enabled the compiler calls them with a
faster `f(arg0, arg1 ...)` instead.

```clj
:fn-invoke-direct true
```
