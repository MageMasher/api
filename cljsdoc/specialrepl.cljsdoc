Special Forms (REPL)

===== Description

These are Special Forms that are only available in a ClojureScript REPL
session.  They mainly allow you to cherry-pick individual facilities out of the
larger [`ns`](special/ns) form.

This is useful in a REPL so you can quickly reference symbols, reload
namespaces if they have changed since you've started the REPL, or change your
evaluation context to a specific namespace.
