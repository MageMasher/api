## Description for Library

This namespace mainly provides reflection capabilities to assist you in
exploring code in a REPL.  It comes with macros that are automatically imported
into your REPL environment, but you can use them outside of one as well.

These macros allow you to explore code by listing/searching available vars in a
namespace and viewing a var's documentation or source.
